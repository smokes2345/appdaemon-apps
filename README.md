# Appdaemon Apps
A repository of useful or interesting Appdaemon modules/scripts.  

## Repository structure
Each module should be contained within it's own directory.  Alongside the module a requirements.txt file should be included with an optional README.md.  

## Installing a module
An installer script is available that copies the module directly from this repository.  The installer can be downloaded using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smokes2345/appdaemon-apps/master/bin/appinstaller.py`.  Once the script is downloaded run it by passing the name of the module you would like to install as an argument, ex. `appinstaller.py algo_timer`.
